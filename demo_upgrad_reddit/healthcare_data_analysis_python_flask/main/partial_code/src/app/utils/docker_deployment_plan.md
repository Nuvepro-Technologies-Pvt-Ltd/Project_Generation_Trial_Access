## Step-by-Step Dockerization Plan for Healthcare AI Flask API (Azure/Healthcare Compliance)

### 1. Component and Dependency Inventory
- List all application components and dependencies, such as:
  - Application source code (all relevant modules under your application directory, e.g., `src/app/`)
  - Select an appropriate Python runtime image (e.g., `python:3.10-slim`), and specify it for your Docker environment.
  - Enumerate and declare all Python dependencies (such as Flask, Flask-Smorest, Marshmallow, PyJWT, etc.) in a `requirements.txt` file.
  - Identify any necessary model files/assets required for model inference.
  - Reference the directory structure for configurations (settings/profiles).
  - Decide on a WSGI server for production (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI).
  - Decide if a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) is needed (note: in Azure, this is often managed by App Gateway).

### 2. Secure Handling of Sensitive Configuration (Secrets Management)
- Describe steps for managing sensitive information:
  - NEVER include hardcoded secrets (JWT_SECRET, DB credentials, API keys) in code or in the Docker image.
  - Use environment variables for all settings and secrets (show example variable names such as `OAUTH2_JWT_SECRET`, etc.).
  - Document best practices for managing environment-specific secrets in deployment guides.
  - For Azure: instruct the team to use Azure Key Vault and Managed Identities for passing secrets securely to containers.
  - For local dev: define the approach to using a `.env` file (ensure `.gitignore` protections), and loading via entrypoint or Docker Compose.

### 3. Storage Management/Healthcare Data Compliance
- Explain and design how persistent storage should be managed:
  - For temporary/intermediate files, describe how to mount Docker volumes or Azure Files at a location like `/data`.
  - For long-term storage, prescribe use of Azure Blob Storage or an encrypted managed DB -- never store PHI in containers or their filesystems.
  - Reiterate the principle that the app container should not persist PHI or PII, and logs/uploads must go to secure, external storage.
  - Specify that logs should go to stdout/stderr, enabling Azure log streaming/monitoring.
  - Document Azure Disk encryption and necessary access controls for volumes.

### 4. Docker Build, Tag, and Push Process (for Azure)
- Provide a template Dockerfile and explain each directive (e.g., base image, working directory, dependency installation, copy steps, environment variables, port exposure, entrypoint).
- Outline the process for:
  - Building the Docker image with an appropriate tag.
  - Tagging the image for Azure Container Registry (ACR) or other registry use.
  - Logging in to ACR using Azure CLI.
  - Pushing the image to the registry.
  - Deploying the image from the registry to Azure App Service or AKS, with references to environment configuration steps.

### 5. Production Readiness: Health Checks and Orchestration
- Provide instructions for implementing a liveness/readiness endpoint (e.g., `/health`) in your Flask API--describe the logic required to check application health and optionally dependencies (DB/model availability).
- Advise on setting up a Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK instruction that calls this endpoint.
- Instruct how to configure liveness/readiness probes in Azure AKS or App Service deployments.
- Document resource requests/limits (with example values) for memory and CPU in K8s manifests, or in Azure App Service plans.
- Recommend running at least two replicas for redundancy, configuring auto scale, and using managed TLS termination for secure connections.
- Remind to set up logging/instrumentation with Azure Monitor/Application Insights, and to plan for regular credential/secrets rotation.

### 6. Audit/Compliance Traceability
- Guide the implementation of detailed request/response logging with PHI masking.
- Explain how to configure and aggregate logs centrally for audit/compliance.
- Emphasize enforcing and auditing all access control and authorization checks in the application backend, documenting denied accesses and failures.

### Summary Table
- Add a table summarizing each step and its description, covering inventory, secrets/config, storage/compliance, image build/deploy, health/resilience, and monitoring/audit.

// Use this plan as a detailed outline to implement a secure, compliant, and production-ready Docker deployment process for your healthcare AI Flask API, adapting each step with the required specifics for your application and Azure environment.
