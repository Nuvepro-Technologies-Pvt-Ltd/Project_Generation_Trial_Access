        # Instructions:
        # 1. Prepare a response dictionary indicating the health status of the service.
        #    For a simple liveness/readiness probe, you may include a key such as "status" with value "ok" if the app is running.
        #    Example: response = {"status": "ok"}
        # 2. If you want to check additional dependencies (like database/status of other services), perform the necessary checks here and update response accordingly.
        # 3. Return the response dictionary as the output.
