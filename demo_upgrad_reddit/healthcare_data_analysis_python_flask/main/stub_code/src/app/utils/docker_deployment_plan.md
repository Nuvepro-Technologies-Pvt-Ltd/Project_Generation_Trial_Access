## Step-by-Step Dockerization Plan for Healthcare AI Flask API (Azure/Healthcare Compliance)

# 1. Component and Dependency Inventory
# - List the application source code, Python runtime, dependencies, model files, config dirs, and any server or proxy requirements.

# 2. Secure Handling of Sensitive Configuration (Secrets Management)
# - Document strategy for NOT storing secrets in source or docker image. 
# - Describe how environment variables and Azure Key Vault/Managed Identities are used for runtime secret provisioning.
# - State approach for local `.env` (gitignored) and document deployment secrets requirements.

# 3. Storage Management/Healthcare Data Compliance
# - Describe where to mount persistent volumes for temporary or generated data.
# - Specify policy: Do not store any PHI inside container or local FS in production.
# - Document how logs and uploads are handled and routed to compliant storage.
# - State guidelines for encryption and permissions on any mounted volumes.

# 4. Docker Build, Tag, and Push Process (for Azure)
# - Outline steps to write a secure Dockerfile for Flask API using a minimal Python base image.
# - Instruct on COPY, pip install, workdir, and entrypoint practices.
# - Provide sample docker build/tag/push steps for Azure Container Registry.
# - Include note for Azure deployment referencing these images and setting up env vars/storage bindings.

# 5. Production Readiness: Health Checks and Orchestration
# - Describe how to implement a `/health` endpoint for liveness/readiness.
# - Instruct where to add HEALTHCHECK directives for Docker and config for Azure/K8s probes.
# - Detail how to describe and configure resource limits (memory, CPU), scaling, and secure connectivity.
# - Note requirements for redundant replicas, scaling, and monitoring strategies.

# 6. Audit/Compliance Traceability
# - Specify instructions for enabling request logging with PHI masking.
# - Describe configuration for centralized logging, monitoring, and compliance reporting.
# - Document requirements for audit traces and access authorization enforcement in backend.

# Summary Table
# | Step | Description |
# |------|-------------|
# | 1 | Inventory components and dependencies |
# | 2 | Secrets/Config injection via env and Azure Key Vault |
# | 3 | External persistent storage, compliance controls |
# | 4 | Build/tag/push Docker image, Azure deploy steps |
# | 5 | Health check route, resource requests/limits, readiness probes |
# | 6 | Monitoring, alerts, PHI masking, secure log routing |

# INSTRUCTION: For each step above, provide detailed process documentation or code snippets as appropriate for your healthcare Flask API dockerization. Replace the instructions above with actual implementation steps, command examples, diagrams, or configuration samples to build the operational deployment, as required by your application and compliance scenarios.
