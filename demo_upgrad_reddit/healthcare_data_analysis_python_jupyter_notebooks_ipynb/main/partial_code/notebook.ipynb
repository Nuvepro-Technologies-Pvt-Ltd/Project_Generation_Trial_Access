    "- **Model Selection Impact:**\n",
    "    - Domain-specific models (e.g., Bio_ClinicalBERT, BioBERT-NER) tend to extract medical concepts (diagnoses, symptoms, medications) more accurately and with appropriate labeling, compared to general NER baselines.\n",
    "    - General models (like distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-ner) primarily label entities as PERSON/ORG/LOC/MISC; clinical details may be missed or mis-labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Choices:**\n",
    "    - `aggregation_strategy` controls entity grouping and can affect granularity. For short input, 'simple' works well; 'none' returns more verbose outputs.\n",
    "    - `max_length` impacts handling of long clinical notes. For very long notes, split into sentences or adjust max_length accordingly.\n",
    "    - Some biomedical NER models do not support aggregation_strategy or may have different output formats (check documentation as models evolve).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations:**\n",
    "    - The reusable, parameterized pipeline structure allows rapid swapping of models and tuning for best entity extraction quality.\n",
    "    - Differences in recognized entities and label types are evident when changing from a domain-specific to a general-purpose model.\n",
    "    - For production, prefer clinical-domain models when available, and always evaluate model performance using a labeled test set.\n",

    "    - Synthetic tabular data imitates real patient distributions and enables rapid prototyping for research, visualization, or algorithmic testing without patient privacy risk.\n",
    "    - The synthetic clinical notes reflect plausible combinations of medical concepts, supporting NLP model testing and iterative prompt engineering.\n",
    "    - Visual comparison demonstrates good alignment in/univariate statistics; for deeper fidelity, advanced methods (e.g. GANs, copulas, or language models) may be considered.\n",

    "- **Privacy:**\n",
    "    - All data is programmatically generated, guaranteeing that no individually-identifying patient information is present.\n",
    "    - Distributional or summary-level attacks are not meaningful (there is no one-to-one mapping with actual patients).\n",

    "    - Synthetic tabular data imitates real patient distributions and enables rapid prototyping for research, visualization, or algorithmic testing without patient privacy risk.\n",
    "    - The synthetic clinical notes reflect plausible combinations of medical concepts, supporting NLP model testing and iterative prompt engineering.\n",
    "    - Visual comparison demonstrates good alignment in/univariate statistics; for deeper fidelity, advanced methods (e.g. GANs, copulas, or language models) may be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy:**\n",
    "    - All data is programmatically generated, guaranteeing that no individually-identifying patient information is present.\n",
    "    - Distributional or summary-level attacks are not meaningful (there is no one-to-one mapping with actual patients).\n",
    "    - For deployment in sensitive settings, privacy-preserving approaches (differential privacy, noise injection, output audits) can further strengthen guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook supports safe, rapid synthetic healthcare data prototyping, visualization, and model pipeline validation, with explicit separation from true patient data. Researchers should always validate downstream analysis pipelines for generalizability beyond synthetic benchmarks.\n",
