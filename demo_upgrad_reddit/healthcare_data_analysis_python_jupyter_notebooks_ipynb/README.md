- Determine and specify the expected input parameters (such as dataset type and size) that users must provide.

- Re-use or extend the OAuth2 authorization mechanism, ensuring only certain user roles can access synthetic data generation.

- Outline the expected output payload structure, referencing healthcare data standards for any generated data fields.

- Plan for clear response messaging in cases of authorization failure or invalid input.
