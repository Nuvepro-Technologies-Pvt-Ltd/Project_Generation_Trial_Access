  // 2. In the "scripts" section, you can add custom commands for building, testing, or deploying your application.
  // 3. Update the "name" and "version" fields if your project information changes.
  // 4. Use this file to manage which libraries are installed with 'npm install' or 'yarn install'.
  // 5. If you need to add development dependencies, use a "devDependencies" section following the structure of "dependencies".
