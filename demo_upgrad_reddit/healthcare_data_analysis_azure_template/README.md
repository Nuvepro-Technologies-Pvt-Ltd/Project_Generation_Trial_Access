- Ensure resources are provisioned in an order that respects dependencies (such as storage before compute services).

- During deployment, pay attention to parameterization, repeatability, and healthcare data compliance (encryption, identity management).

- After provisioning, verify within the Azure Portal or resource list that all required resources have been created as per your plan.


**ðŸ“¤ Expected Output:**  
All core backend, data, and ML resources for the healthcare AI platform are provisioned in Azure, ready for use by the platform microservices and pipelines. Success will be measured by a complete resources list that matches the blueprint.

**ðŸ›  Instructions:**  

- Identify required subnets, network security groups, and access control policies for backend/data/ML resources previously provisioned.

- Apply network isolation, firewall rules, and access policies (for example, restricting Storage to only necessary services, enabling private link/endpoints where needed).

- Implement role-based access control for each service according to least-privilege principles.

- Document all implemented controls, describing explicitly how they support healthcare data security and compliance needs.


**ðŸ“¤ Expected Output:**  
All Azure backend/data/ML resources have proper network isolation and fine-grained access control, documented with rationale for each security setting. This output is validated by the alignment to healthcare compliance needs.
