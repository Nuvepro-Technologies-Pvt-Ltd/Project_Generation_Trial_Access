## Problem Statement
- ## Problem Statement: Building a Productivity Todo App for a Modern Team Using React + Flask

---

### Scenario: You Are the Productivity Solutions Developer

**Real-World Role:**  
You have recently joined “Efficiently Inc.,” a fast-growing tech company focused on improving internal productivity. The company’s employees have expressed frustration: with increasing tasks and projects, they often lose track of priorities, resulting in missed deadlines and decreased team collaboration. Leadership has identified the need for a modern, intuitive todo app tailored to track, update, and manage personal tasks efficiently.

**Problem Context:**  
As an entry-level Full Stack Web Developer at Efficiently Inc., you are tasked with building a full stack Productivity Todo Application using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. This application must support seamless task management with a clean, responsive interface, reliable backend, robust API design, and a codebase that is friendly for future enhancements and team collaboration. Stakeholders expect the project to set a foundation for robust developer workflows, testing, and deployment practices.

**Objective:**  
Develop a feature-complete Todo App that allows users to:
- Add new todo items.
- Edit existing todo items.
- Delete todo items.
- Mark todo items as completed or incomplete.
- View the full list of todos.
- Filter todos by all/completed/incomplete.

Your solution must demonstrate:
- Full CRUD capabilities with user actions reflected in a persistent backend.
- A RESTful, documented API layer.
- Responsive, real-time updates via robust frontend-backend communication.
- A repository structure and CI-friendly codebase, including clear separation of concerns, basic tests, and maintainable conventions.

---

### Project Requirements and Feature Set

#### Core Features:

1. **Add Todo**:  
   Users must be able to enter and save new todo items using a simple, validated form.

2. **Edit Todo**:  
   Users can modify the text/details of existing todos. Edits are reflected both immediately in the UI and persisted in the backend.

3. **Delete Todo**:  
   Users can remove a todo. Deletions are confirmed, and removed from both frontend and backend.

4. **Mark as Completed/Incomplete**:  
   Users must toggle the completion status of each todo, with clear visual cues.

5. **View Todos**:  
   All todos appear in a list, with up-to-date information reflected instantly across the interface.

6. **Filter Todos**:  
   Users can filter the list to view only completed, incomplete, or all todos. Filtering is handled on the frontend for responsiveness.

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will demonstrate:

- **Full Stack CRUD Application Development**:  
  You will design, implement, and test full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations end-to-end using React (frontend) and Flask (backend).

- **API-First Design and Integration**:  
  You will expose a clear REST API in Flask, including routes for each CRUD operation. Frontend will interact exclusively via these endpoints.

- **Frontend-Backend Communication**:  
  You will implement robust communication patterns between React and Flask—sending and handling HTTP requests, managing async data updates, handling errors, and reflecting state changes in real time on the UI.

- **CI-Friendly Project Structure with Testing**:  
  Your codebase will use clear conventions, logical folder structure, and environments (development/test). You will include both backend (Pytest or unittest for Flask) and frontend tests (Jest for React). Readme documentation should clearly explain setup, running tests, and project structure for a new developer.

---

### Target Audience Alignment

**Who this is for:**  
- Beginner to Intermediate Web Developers with a basic understanding of React, Flask, REST, and JavaScript/Python.
- Assumptions: You are comfortable creating React components and routes, using Python functions and Flask routes, and understand basic state management. No advanced deployment, auth, or third-party integrations are expected.
- Emphasis is on practical, “job-ready” skills: building, maintaining, and testing a production-quality codebase in a collaborative, transparent manner.

---

### Project Timeline (2–3 Days)

#### Day 1:  
- Set up backend (Flask) project using recommended best practices and create models/routes for todos.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints: create, read (list all), update (by ID), delete (by ID), and toggle completion.
- Set up project-level and API-level tests (e.g., testing CRUD routes).
- Document API usage in a simple format (e.g., Markdown README or Swagger/OpenAPI comments).

#### Day 2:  
- Scaffold frontend (React) app structure.
- Implement core pages and components: Todo List, Add Todo Form, Edit Todo Modal/Inline, Filter Buttons, and status toggling.
- Connect React frontend to Flask API via fetch/axios, handling API errors visibly.
- Implement basic frontend tests (component rendering, task addition, filter logic).
- Sync all CRUD actions between frontend and backend; ensure UI state matches backend database.

#### Day 3:  
- Polish UI/UX: confirm that feedback is immediate on all actions; refine button states and accessibility.
- Finalize project documentation: setup, run, test instructions, and code conventions.
- Conduct full workflow test: add/edit/delete/complete/filter todos, run all tests, fix any bugs.
- Prepare a handoff summary for potential collaborators (in README).

---

### Deliverables

- **Full Source Code:** Includes React frontend and Flask backend, organized with clearly separated responsibilities.
- **API Documentation:** Endpoints, sample requests/responses, and testing instructions.
- **Testing Suite:** Demonstrates basic backend and frontend tests.
- **README.md:** Includes installation, development, testing, and contribution guidelines.
- **Live Demo (optional):** If time allows, provide simple demo instructions for local run.

---

### Key Expectations

- Stay within the prescribed feature set.
- All features—add, edit, delete, (un)complete, view, filter—must be available and persist across frontend/backend.
- Codebase must support collaboration—clean structure, basic tests, clear docs.
- Avoid complex extras (e.g. user auth, tags, notifications, or integrations).

---

**Summary:**  
You will build a job-ready Productivity Todo App—demonstrating complete full stack CRUD, modern API design, frontend-backend integration, and CI-friendly habits—using React and Flask. This project mirrors real industry challenges and expectations in team-based productivity tools, equipping you with the core skills required for early-career Full Stack Web Development roles.
