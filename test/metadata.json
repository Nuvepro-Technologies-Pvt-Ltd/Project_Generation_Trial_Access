The company’s employees have expressed frustration: with increasing tasks and projects, they often lose track of priorities, resulting in missed deadlines and decreased team collaboration. Leadership has identified the need for a modern, intuitive todo app tailored to track, update, and manage personal tasks efficiently.\n\n**Problem Context:**  \nAs an entry-level Full Stack Web Developer at Efficiently Inc., you are tasked with building a full stack Productivity Todo Application using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. This application must support seamless task management with a clean, responsive interface, reliable backend, robust API design, and a codebase that is friendly for future enhancements and team collaboration. Stakeholders expect the project to set a foundation for robust developer workflows, testing, and deployment practices.\n\n**Objective:**  \nDevelop a feature-complete Todo App that allows users to:\n- Add new todo items.\n- Edit existing todo items.\n- Delete todo items.\n- Mark todo items as completed or incomplete.\n- View the full list of todos.\n- Filter todos by all/completed/incomplete.\n\nYour solution must demonstrate:\n- Full CRUD capabilities with user actions reflected in a persistent backend.\n- A RESTful, documented API layer.\n- Responsive, real-time updates via robust frontend-backend communication.\n- A repository structure and CI-friendly codebase, including clear separation of concerns, basic tests, and maintainable conventions.\n\n---\n\n### Project Requirements and Feature Set\n\n#### Core Features:\n\n1. **Add Todo**:  \n   Users must be able to enter and save new todo items using a simple, validated form.\n\n2. **Edit Todo**:  \n   Users can modify the text/details of existing todos. Edits are reflected both immediately in the UI and persisted in the backend.\n\n3. **Delete Todo**:  \n   Users can remove a todo. Deletions are confirmed, and removed from both frontend and backend.\n\n4. **Mark as Completed/Incomplete**:  \n   Users must toggle the completion status of each todo, with clear visual cues.\n\n5. **View Todos**:  \n   All todos appear in a list, with up-to-date information reflected instantly across the interface.\n\n6. **Filter Todos**:  \n   Users can filter the list to view only completed, incomplete, or all todos. Filtering is handled on the frontend for responsiveness.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n\nBy completing this project, you will demonstrate:\n\n- **Full Stack CRUD Application Development**:  \n  You will design, implement, and test full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations end-to-end using React (frontend) and Flask (backend).\n\n- **API-First Design and Integration**:  \n  You will expose a clear REST API in Flask, including routes for each CRUD operation. Frontend will interact exclusively via these endpoints.\n\n- **Frontend-Backend Communication**:  \n  You will implement robust communication patterns between React and Flask—sending and handling HTTP requests, managing async data updates, handling errors, and reflecting state changes in real time on the UI.\n\n- **CI-Friendly Project Structure with Testing**:  \n  Your codebase will use clear conventions, logical folder structure, and environments (development/test). You will include both backend (Pytest or unittest for Flask) and frontend tests (Jest for React). Readme documentation should clearly explain setup, running tests, and project structure for a new developer.\n\n---\n\n### Target Audience Alignment\n\n**Who this is for:**  \n- Beginner to Intermediate Web Developers with a basic understanding of React, Flask, REST, and JavaScript/Python.\n- Assumptions: You are comfortable creating React components and routes, using Python functions and Flask routes, and understand basic state management. No advanced deployment, auth, or third-party integrations are expected.\n- Emphasis is on practical, “job-ready” skills: building, maintaining, and testing a production-quality codebase in a collaborative, transparent manner.\n\n---\n\n### Project Timeline (2–3 Days)\n\n#### Day 1:  \n- Set up backend (Flask) project using recommended best practices and create models/routes for todos.\n- Implement RESTful API endpoints: create, read (list all), update (by ID), delete (by ID), and toggle completion.\n- Set up project-level and API-level tests (e.g., testing CRUD routes).\n- Document API usage in a simple format (e.g., Markdown README or Swagger/OpenAPI comments).\n\n#### Day 2:  \n- Scaffold frontend (React) app structure.\n- Implement core pages and components: Todo List, Add Todo Form, Edit Todo Modal/Inline, Filter Buttons, and status toggling.\n- Connect React frontend to Flask API via fetch/axios, handling API errors visibly.\n- Implement basic frontend tests (component rendering, task addition, filter logic).\n- Sync all CRUD actions between frontend and backend; ensure UI state matches backend database.\n\n#### Day 3:  \n- Polish UI/UX: confirm that feedback is immediate on all actions; refine button states and accessibility.\n- Finalize project documentation: setup, run, test instructions, and code conventions.\n- Conduct full workflow test: add/edit/delete/complete/filter todos, run all tests, fix any bugs.\n- Prepare a handoff summary for potential collaborators (in README).\n\n---\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- **Full Source Code:** Includes React frontend and Flask backend, organized with clearly separated responsibilities.\n- **API Documentation:** Endpoints, sample requests/responses, and testing instructions.\n- **Testing Suite:** Demonstrates basic backend and frontend tests.\n- **README.md:** Includes installation, development, testing, and contribution guidelines.\n- **Live Demo (optional):** If time allows, provide simple demo instructions for local run.\n\n---\n\n### Key Expectations\n\n- Stay within the prescribed feature set.\n- All features—add, edit, delete, (un)complete, view, filter—must be available and persist across frontend/backend.\n- Codebase must support collaboration—clean structure, basic tests, clear docs.\n- Avoid complex extras (e.g. user auth, tags, notifications, or integrations).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou will build a job-ready Productivity Todo App—demonstrating complete full stack CRUD, modern API design, frontend-backend integration, and CI-friendly habits—using React and Flask. This project mirrors real industry challenges and expectations in team-based productivity tools, equipping you with the core skills required for early-career Full Stack Web Development roles.\n\n---\n\n**Begin your implementation now—carefully following each step—to create your team’s next essential productivity tool!**"
