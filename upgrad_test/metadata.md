## Problem Statement
- Scenario-Based Problem Statement: Productivity Todo App (Full Stack: Flask + React)

Role & Context:
You are a Junior Web Developer recently hired by "ProductivityPro," a fast-growing startup focused on helping individuals and small teams manage their daily tasks more efficiently. The company is launching a new initiative to build a modern, user-friendly Todo Application that will serve as the foundation for future productivity tools. Your manager has tasked you with developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this Todo App using a full stack approach: Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

Problem Context:
In today’s fast-paced work environment, individuals and teams struggle to keep track of their daily tasks, leading to missed deadlines and decreased productivity. ProductivityPro aims to address this challenge by providing a simple, intuitive web application that allows users to manage their todos seamlessly. The MVP must support essential task management features and ensure that all data is reliably stored and retrievable.

Objective:
Your objective is to design and implement a full stack web application—a Todo App—that enables users to:
- Add new todo items
- View a list of all todos
- Mark todos as completed
- Delete todo items
- Edit existing todos
- Persist todos in a database

You will use Flask to build a RESTful API backend and React to create an interactive frontend interface. The application must demonstrate a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, and all data must be stored in a persistent database (such as SQLite).

Learning Outcomes:
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand full stack web application architecture by designing and connecting a Flask backend with a React frontend.
- Develop RESTful APIs with Flask to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todo items.
- Build interactive UIs with React, allowing users to manage their todos in real time.
- Integrate frontend and backend by connecting React components to Flask API endpoints.
- Implement and test CRUD operations, ensuring that all features (add, view, edit, delete, mark as completed) work as intended and persist data in the database.

Target Audience Alignment:
This project is designed for Beginner to Intermediate Developers interested in building full stack web applications. It assumes you have basic familiarity with Python, JavaScript, and web development concepts, but does not require advanced experience with Flask or React. The tasks are scoped to be achievable within 1-2 days, focusing on practical, industry-relevant skills.

Time Constraints:
You are expected to complete the MVP within 1-2 days. Suggested milestones:
- Day 1: Set up the Flask backend, define the data model, and implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations. Test endpoints using a tool like Postman.
- Day 2: Build the React frontend, connect it to the Flask API, and implement all UI features (add, view, edit, delete, mark as completed). Ensure data persists and updates correctly.

Project Requirements & Tasks:

1. Backend (Flask)
   - Set up a Flask project with a SQLite database to store todo items.
   - Define a Todo model with fields: id, title, description (optional), completed (boolean), and timestamp.
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints:
     - POST /todos: Add a new todo item.
     - GET /todos: Retrieve a list of all todos.
     - PUT /todos/<id>: Edit an existing todo item.
     - PATCH /todos/<id>/complete: Mark a todo as completed.
     - DELETE /todos/<id>: Delete a todo item.
   - Ensure all endpoints perform appropriate CRUD operations and persist data in the database.
   - Test all endpoints for correct functionality.

2. Frontend (React)
   - Set up a React project and design a clean, intuitive UI for managing todos.
   - Implement components to:
     - Display the list of todos, showing completed and incomplete items distinctly.
     - Add new todo items via a form.
     - Edit existing todos inline or via a modal/dialog.
     - Mark todos as completed (e.g., with a checkbox or button).
     - Delete todo items.
   - Connect React components to the Flask API using fetch or axios for all CRUD operations.
   - Ensure UI updates reflect changes in the backend (e.g., after adding, editing, or deleting a todo).

3. Integration & Testing
   - Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.
   - Test the complete workflow: adding, viewing, editing, marking as completed, and deleting todos.
   - Verify that all changes persist in the database and are reflected in the UI.

4. Deliverables
   - A GitHub repository containing:
     - Flask backend code (with requirements.txt and setup instructions)
     - React frontend code (with package.json and setup instructions)
     - A README file explaining how to run both the backend and frontend, and how to use the application.

Success Criteria:
- The application allows users to add, view, edit, mark as completed, and delete todo items.
- All data is persisted in a database and accurately reflected in the UI.
- The frontend and backend are cleanly separated and communicate via RESTful API calls.
- The codebase is well-organized and documented for easy understanding and future extension.

By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in building a full stack web application using Flask and React, mastering the essential skills required for modern web development in the productivity domain.
