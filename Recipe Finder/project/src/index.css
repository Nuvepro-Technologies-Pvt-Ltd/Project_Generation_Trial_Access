/*
There is no executable logic or JavaScript/TypeScript code in src/index.css; only static CSS declarations.
As such, no standard unit/integration tests using frameworks like JUnit, Jest, or Mocha apply to this file.

However, you may perform visual regression testing or CSS linting to ensure correctness and maintainability.
Below is an example CSS linting test using stylelint for static validation, along with comments for maintainers:
*/

/* stylelint-disable-next-line comment-empty-line-before */
/* This file is validated via stylelint in the build/test pipeline. Example test configuration (stylelint.config.js):
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'stylelint-config-standard',
    'stylelint-config-prettier',
  ],
  rules: {
    'color-hex-case': 'lower',
    'string-quotes': 'single',
    'block-no-empty': true,
    'selector-type-no-unknown': true,
    // Add additional rules as needed to enforce team standards
  },
};
*/

/*
To test this CSS file:
- Run `npx stylelint src/index.css` (or your preferred package runner) in CI or locally.
- Optionally, employ visual regression tests using tools like Percy, BackstopJS, or Chromatic for UI consistency.
- For integration, load the app and check the body and #root styles are applied as intended.
