      INSTRUCTIONS:
      - The <div id="root"></div> is the mounting point for the React application.
      - Do not remove or rename the <div id="root"></div> element. The React app is injected here by the main JavaScript bundle.
      - If you want to display a message for users who have JavaScript disabled, replace the <noscript> content as needed.
      - All required meta tags for responsiveness, favicon, description, title, and theme-color are already set. You can update the content and branding if desired.
      - To add additional global resources (such as fonts or global stylesheets), place <link> or <script> tags inside the <head> as needed.
      - Bootstrap CSS is already included via CDN for styling React components.
