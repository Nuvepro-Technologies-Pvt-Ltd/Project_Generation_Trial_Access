  TODO: Write the basic HTML structure for mounting a React app.
  - Add doctype and html, head, and body tags.
  - In the <head> include meta tags (charset, viewport, theme-color, description), a title, favicon link, and any required stylesheet links (e.g., Bootstrap).
  - In the <body>, add a <noscript> message for users with JavaScript disabled.
  - Add a <div> with the id="root" which React will use to mount the app.
  - Ensure the structure supports a typical React single-page application.
