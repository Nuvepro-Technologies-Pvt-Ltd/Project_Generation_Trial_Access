The authors aim to explore the methodology and data representations used in deep learning models and their application to forecast stock market behavior. The study attempts to provide a comprehensive and objective assessment of both the advantages and drawbacks of deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis and prediction. The literature explores the effects of three unsupervised feature extraction methods - principal component analysis, auto encoder, and the restricted Boltzmann machine\u2014on the network\u2019s overall ability to predict future market behavior. The literature also offers practical insights and potentially useful directions for further investigation into how deep learning networks can be effectively used for stock market analysis and prediction (Chong et al., 2017).\nWhat type of data is used to understand applications?\nThe study uses financial data, including historical stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant market indicators, to understand the applications of deep learning networks in stock market analysis. These data sources provide insights into the patterns and dynamics of stock market behaviour. High-frequency intraday stock returns data from Korean stock market is used by the authors. The high-frequency data is used to get a large data set and in turn to overcome data-snooping and over-fitting problems inevitable in neural network or any other non-linear models. \nWhat methodologies were applied to solve the problem?\nThe authors of the study propose a deep feature learning-based stock market prediction model. From the lagged stock returns data, the authors generate seven sets of features employing three data representations: principal component analysis, autoencoder, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Three layer deep neural networks were constructed to predict the future stock returns.\nWhat were the opportunities for future work?\nFactors such as trading volume and the price of a derivative linked to a stock can be considered as variables for future studies. Identifying the relationship between these factors and future price movements can also be considered further.\nCritical Analysis\nIn the process of a more detailed research on the existing literature, the research paper is analysed to learn the existing applications of machine learning algorithms at various stages of investment analysis. This paper deals with predictive analytics on the stock market returns by applying advanced and deep neural networks for the purpose of feature engineering and predictions. The advantage of applying such non-linear algorithms goes a long way in the investment decision making especially when domain knowledge is lesser or unavailable in the process of investment decision making and there is also an existence time pressure that impacts the decision-making process.\n\n2.2.4\tStudy 7 - Literature  \nWhat were the problems studied or researched?\nThe study revolves around stock market forecasting using ensemble deep Q-learning agents. The author in the research aims at proposing an ensemble of reinforcement learning approaches which do not use annotations (i.e. market goes up or down) to learn, but rather learn how to maximize a return function over the training stage. In order to achieve this goal, the authors exploit a Q-learning agent trained several times with the same training data and investigate its ensemble behavior in important real-world stock markets (Carta et al., 2021).\nWhat type of data is used to understand applications?\nThe data points collected for this study are mainly the historical stock market data, including price movements, trading volumes, and other relevant financial indicators. The chosen markets are related to futures: the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 (S&P500), and the German stock index (DAX). These datasets were acquired from a brokerage company, and the authors used the hourly resolution datasets of prices initially.\nWhat methodologies were applied to solve the problem?\nThe methodology of focus for this study is deep Q-learning agents within an ensemble framework. An ensemble methodology for RL agents, which involves the use of different models trained at different iterations (epochs), with further analysis of the behavior of these ensembles through different agreement thresholds. It explores mixing Deep Q-learning RL strategies in ensemble methods considering different training iterations to predict different future markets. The final decision consists of an ensemble of decisions from different agents and is parametric to different levels of agreement thresholds and agents\u2019 configurations.\nWhat were the opportunities for future work?\nThe opportunities for future work in this study and research include further exploration of advanced ensemble techniques to enhance the performance of the ensemble deep Q-learning approach. The authors suggest investigating the effectiveness of different aggregation methods and fusion techniques to improve the consensus forecast of the ensemble. Additionally, future research could focus on optimizing the hyper parameters and architecture of the deep Q-learning agents to further enhance their individual performance. Furthermore, the application of the ensemble deep Q-learning approach to different stock markets and the evaluation of its performance in various market conditions and various other products such as bonds and commodities markets can present opportunities for future research.\nCritical Analysis\nThe study employs real-world stock market data and evaluates the performance of the proposed multi-DQN ensemble model. The authors provide empirical evidence and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble approach. This empirical validation enhances the practical relevance of the study and provides insights into the performance of the multi-DQN model in real stock market scenarios. \nThe strength of this study is its focus on the integration of deep Q-learning agents and ensemble methods for stock market forecasting. The authors recognize the limitations of individual models and propose a collaborative approach to enhance prediction accuracy. By combining multiple deep Q-learning agents, the study harnesses the diversity of models and their collective knowledge to achieve improved forecasting performance. \nHowever, one limitation of the study is the complexity of the proposed multi-DQN ensemble model. The authors provide limited details on the implementation and training process of the individual deep Q-learning agents and the ensemble mechanism. A more in-depth explanation of these aspects would have provided a better understanding of the model and its practical implementation. Additionally, the study could have further discussed the interpretability of the multi-DQN ensemble model. Deep Q-learning models are known for their black-box nature, and understanding the decision-making process of the ensemble and the significance of input features is essential for practical application and adoption.\n2.2.5\tStudy 8 - Literature\nWhat were the problems studied or researched?\nThe problems studied or researched in the paper revolve around stock price direction forecasting using deep neural networks (DNNs) and technical analysis indicators. The authors aim to develop a methodology that combines feature selection techniques with DNNs to improve the accuracy of predicting the direction of stock prices. The authors discussed feature selection in the context of deep neural network models to predict the stock price direction. They investigated a set of 124 technical analysis indicators used as explanatory variables in the recent literature and specialized trading websites. They applied three feature selection methods to shrink the feature set aiming to eliminate redundant information from similar indicators (Peng et al., 2021).\nWhat type of data is used to understand applications?\nThe study uses historical stock market data, including price movements, trading volumes, and various technical analysis indicators, to understand applications of feature selection and DNNs in stock price direction forecasting. These data sources provide the necessary input for training and testing the DNN models.\nThe authors collected daily data between January 1st, 2008 and March 1st, 2019 from firms that composed financial market indexes from seven markets, namely: United States (S&P 100 Index), United Kingdom (FTSE 100 Index), France (CAC 40 Index), Germany (DAX-30 Index), Japan (Top 50 assets from NIKKEI 225 Index), China (Top 50 assets from SSE 180 Index) and Brazil (Bovespa Index).\nWhat methodologies were applied to solve the problem?\nThe methodologies applied in the research involve the integration of feature selection techniques with DNNs. The authors employ various feature selection methods, such as correlation-based measures and mutual information, to identify and select the most relevant technical analysis indicators. They then utilize DNNs, such as feed forward neural networks, to capture complex patterns and relationships in the historical stock market data. The models are trained on the selected features to predict the direction of stock prices. The authors have tested the empirical performance of deep neural networks for seven markets by applying different settings of architecture and regularization techniques.\nWhat were the opportunities for future work?\nThe opportunities for future work identified in the research include further exploration of advanced feature selection techniques to improve the model's performance in selecting relevant indicators. The authors suggest investigating the impact of different feature selection algorithms and strategies on prediction accuracy. Additionally, future research could focus on enhancing the interpretability of the DNN models in stock price direction forecasting and exploring the combination of feature selection with other machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods or deep learning architectures. Furthermore, the application of the proposed methodology to different financial markets and the evaluation of its performance across various time periods present opportunities for future research.\nCritical Analysis\nThe study explores various feature selection algorithms, such as correlation-based measures and mutual information, and evaluates their impact on model performance. This comprehensive analysis allows for a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of different feature selection techniques in the context of stock price direction forecasting. The strength of this study is its focus on incorporating feature selection techniques into the forecasting process. The authors recognize the importance of identifying and utilizing the most informative indicators for stock price direction prediction. By applying feature selection methods, the study enhances the model's ability to extract meaningful patterns and reduce noise from the data. Moreover, the study utilizes real-world stock market data and evaluates the performance of the proposed methodology. The authors provide empirical evidence and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. This empirical validation enhances the credibility and practical applicability of the study's findings.\nHowever, one limitation of the study is its focus solely on technical analysis indicators without considering other types of data or information. Stock market prices are influenced by various factors, including fundamental analysis, market news, and macroeconomic indicators. A more comprehensive analysis that incorporates additional data sources could provide a more holistic view of stock price direction prediction. Additionally, the study does not extensively discuss the interpretability of the DNN models. Deep neural networks are known for their black-box nature, and understanding the underlying reasons for their predictions is essential for practical application and adoption. Further research could address this limitation and explore methods to enhance the interpretability of DNN models in stock price direction forecasting.\nStudy 9 - Literature \nWhat were the problems studied or researched?\nThe problems studied or researched in  revolve around forecasting stock prices using an ensemble approach that combines deep learning models with technical analysis. The authors aim to develop a methodology that leverages the strengths of both approaches to improve the accuracy of stock price predictions (Kamara et al., 2022).\nWhat type of data is used to understand applications?\nThe study utilizes historical stock market data, including price movements, trading volumes, and various technical analysis indicators, to understand applications of the ensemble approach in stock price forecasting. These data points provide the necessary input for training and testing the deep learning models and technical analysis-based models.\nWhat methodologies were applied to solve the problem?\nThe methodology applied in the research involves the integration of deep learning models with technical analysis indicators within a boosted hybrid ensemble framework. The authors employ various deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to capture complex patterns in the historical stock market data. They also incorporate technical analysis indicators, such as moving averages or relative strength index (RSI), to consider the insights from traditional technical analysis. Boosting techniques are applied to combine the predictions of individual models into an ensemble, enhancing the overall forecasting performance.\nWhat were the opportunities for future work?\nThe opportunities for future work identified in the research include further exploration of advanced ensemble techniques to improve the performance of the boosted hybrid ensemble approach. The authors suggest investigating the impact of different ensemble algorithms, feature combinations, and model weighting strategies on prediction accuracy. Additionally, future research could focus on the integration of alternative technical analysis indicators or the inclusion of external factors, such as news sentiment or macroeconomic indicators, to enhance the robustness of the ensemble model. Furthermore, the application of the proposed methodology to different financial markets and the evaluation of its performance across various time periods present opportunities for future research.\nCritical Analysis\nThe study explores various deep learning architectures, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as technical analysis indicators. By combining these different approaches, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each model and their collective performance within the ensemble. The strength of this study is its focus on combining deep learning models and technical analysis to enhance stock price forecasting. The authors recognize the limitations and potential biases of individual models and propose an ensemble approach to mitigate these issues. By leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple models, the study aims to achieve improved prediction accuracy and robustness.\nAlso, the study employs real-world stock market data and evaluates the performance of the proposed ensemble approach. The authors provide empirical evidence and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methodology. This empirical validation enhances the practical relevance of the study and provides insights into the performance of the boosted hybrid ensemble in real stock market scenarios.\nHowever, one limitation of the study is the lack of a detailed explanation of the ensemble mechanism and the weightings assigned to individual models. A more in-depth discussion of the ensemble approach and its optimization would have provided a better understanding of how the collective intelligence is harnessed and how individual model contributions are integrated. Additionally, the study could have further discussed the interpretability of the ensemble approach. Ensemble models can be considered as black-box systems, and understanding the decision-making process and the relative importance of input features in the ensemble would have enhanced the practical implementation and adoption.\n3. \tComparative Analysis\nAll the 9 literatures analysed in this review are compared in a graphical mind map in the following figures."
